# Bookmarks Mobile

Access and manage your nextcloud bookmarks on your phone!

**NB! This app is still under active development and not released, yet.**

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or start discussions in the already open issues. If you would like
to contribute code check the [kanban board](https://github.com/zonradkuse/nextcloud-bookmarks-mobile/projects/1), please. Unassigned issues that are
in TODO are open for contributions. Let us know that you would like to start working on a specific
issue. We can guide you from there :)

### Workflow

Any code change should be done through PRs.

As the [boards](https://github.com/zonradkuse/nextcloud-bookmarks-mobile/projects) suggests, any issue/pr will go through predefined steps
* TODO -- equivalent of a backlog. This is the starting point of any issue
* In Progress -- the issue has an assignee and work has started in any way
* Review in progress -- the PR has been opened and is being reviews
* Reviewer approved -- the PR is approved but not merged, yet
* Ready for deployment -- the PR merged and waiting for a deployment
* Done -- the PR is deployed and the issue is fully implemented

If any issue is currently blocked by any dependency (internal or external) it will go to
__Blocked__.
